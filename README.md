# High School Program: Brain Stimulation & Brain Imaging

<img src="/Figure_HS.jpg" alt="High School Students Summer Program" width="600" style="border-radius: 12px; margin-bottom: 20px;" />

A **guided, step-by-step learning path** for high school students to explore the brain, EEG/fMRI basics, and reproducible science—no prior coding required.

> 👉 This repository also powers a website students can follow module by module.  
> After you enable **GitHub Pages** (Settings → Pages → Build from `main` → `/docs`), the site will live at:
> `https://<your-username>.github.io/High-School-Program/`

## Who this is for
- High school students (grades 9–12), curious about neuroscience & technology.
- No programming experience needed.

## What you’ll learn (outcomes)
- Core concept about noninvasive brain stimulation and brain imaging methods 
- Basic MATLAB codes for reading, plotting, and understanding simple data  
- Reproducible science: folders, README, citations, and version control (Git/GitHub)  
- A mini-capstone: ask a question, analyze a tiny dataset, make a clear figure, explain it

## Format & pacing
- **Self-paced modules** that build on each other
- Each module has: goals → a short tutorial → checklist → a tiny task
- Mentor feedback via GitHub Issues/PRs

## Quick start (students)
1. Create a **GitHub account**.
2. Open this project in your browser (start with the website once Pages is enabled).
3. Begin with **Module 0: Setup** and work down the list.

## Learning Path (Modules)

> The links below assume each module lives in `docs/modules/` (see repo structure below).

1. **Module 0 — Setup**  
   Accounts, GitHub basics, working in the browser (VS Code Web / Codespaces), how to turn in work  
   👉 `docs/modules/00-setup.md`

2. **Module 1 — Neuroscience & Signals 101**  
   Brain regions at a glance, what EEG/fMRI measure, safety & ethics  
   👉 `docs/modules/01-neuro101.md`

3. **Module 2 — Python Fundamentals**  
   Variables, lists, reading a CSV, basic plots with `matplotlib`  
   👉 `docs/modules/02-python-basics.md`

4. **Module 3 — EEG Basics**  
   Load → filter → visualize a simple EEG snippet; what is noise? what is a band?  
   👉 `docs/modules/03-eeg-basics.md`

5. **Module 4 — fMRI Basics**  
   Anatomy vs. function, slices/volumes, simple viewing & orientation  
   👉 `docs/modules/04-fmri-basics.md`

6. **Module 5 — Reproducible Science**  
   Folder structure, README, citing sources, version control with Git  
   👉 `docs/modules/05-reproducible-science.md`

7. **Module 6 — Mini-Capstone**  
   Pick a tiny dataset → ask a question → make a clean figure → write a one-page summary  
   👉 `docs/modules/06-capstone.md`

## How to submit your work
- Each module has a **Checklist** and a **Turn-in** section.
- Create a branch, commit your work, and open a **Pull Request** (PR).
- Mentors review via PR comments. You’ll make edits and merge when approved.
- Questions? Open an **Issue** with the module name in the title (e.g., “[M2] Plot not loading”).

---

## Tech you’ll use
- **GitHub** (repos, issues, pull requests)  
- **VS Code Web** or **GitHub Codespaces** (browser-based—no installs needed)  
- **Python** + `matplotlib` for simple plots

> Prefer installs? You can also work locally with Python + VS Code, but the browser option is simplest.
