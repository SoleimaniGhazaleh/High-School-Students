  <summary>Who’s eligible?</summary>
  <div class="content">
    <p>We’re looking for curious, motivated high school students who want to explore <strong>neuroscience</strong>, <strong>brain imaging (MRI/fMRI)</strong>, and <strong>neuromodulation (tDCS/TMS)</strong> in a friendly, step-by-step program.</p>

    <p><strong>You’re a great fit if you…</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>are in <strong>grades 9–12</strong> (or equivalent)</li>
      <li>are <strong>excited about neuroscience</strong> and how we map/guide brain activity</li>
      <li>enjoy <strong>learning by doing</strong> (short modules → tiny tasks → mini-project)</li>
      <li>can <strong>commit a few hours per week</strong> during the program window</li>
      <li>have a <strong>browser + internet</strong> (no installs required)</li>
      <li>are <strong>kind, respectful, and ready to collaborate</strong></li>
      <li>(If under 18) can provide <strong>parent/guardian consent</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Nice to have (but not required):</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Comfort with basic algebra/graphs</li>
      <li>Curiosity about coding (we’ll guide you—no experience needed)</li>
      <li>Interest in making <strong>clean, informative figures</strong></li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</details>


<details class="drop">
  <summary>What you’ll learn (the fun version)</summary>
  <div class="content">
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Brain map navigation:</strong> read structural MRI—slices, landmarks, and lingo.</li>
      <li><strong>fMRI in living color:</strong> see how tasks light up networks (and what “activation” really means).</li>
      <li><strong>tDCS planning:</strong> place electrodes, set safe currents, and preview the electric field on a head model.</li>
      <li><strong>TMS targeting:</strong> understand coil positioning, the famous “click,” and how we aim precisely.</li>
      <li><strong>Reproducible science:</strong> folders that make sense, a clear README, citations, and version control.</li>
      <li><strong>Tiny MATLAB or Python for figures:</strong> load a small table and make a clean, labeled plot.</li>
      <li><strong>Mini-capstone:</strong> ask a tiny question → make a compelling figure → explain it in 60 seconds.</li>
      <li><strong>Science storytelling:</strong> craft a one-slide lightning talk for non-scientists.</li>
      <li><strong>Safety &amp; ethics:</strong> consent, privacy, and why non-invasive really means non-invasive.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</details>


<details class="drop">
  <summary>Why spend your summer doing science?</summary>
  <div class="content">
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Real-world experience:</strong> Work with structural MRI, fMRI, and safe non-invasive neuromodulation (tDCS/TMS)—not just textbook examples.</li>
      <li><strong>College &amp; career signal:</strong> Shows initiative, persistence, and genuine interest in neuroscience—great for applications and interviews.</li>
      <li><strong>Portfolio you can show:</strong> Leave with a clean figure, a one-page summary, and a tiny project in a public repo.</li>
      <li><strong>Try before you major:</strong> Explore brain science now to see if it sparks you (and which roles you might like).</li>
      <li><strong>Transferable skills:</strong> Data sense, clear writing, basic plotting, and reproducible workflows—useful in any STEM field.</li>
      <li><strong>Mentorship &amp; community:</strong> Friendly guidance, feedback on your PRs, and peers who are curious like you.</li>
      <li><strong>Confidence + curiosity:</strong> Break big ideas into small steps—you’ll be surprised how quickly you can make something real.</li>
      <li><strong>Ethics &amp; safety literacy:</strong> Understand consent, privacy, and why “non-invasive” matters in brain research.</li>
      <li><strong>Purposeful fun:</strong> Maps, models, and mini-discoveries you can explain in 60 seconds.</li>
    </ul>
